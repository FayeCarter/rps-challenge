# Task

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Aims

- [X] the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- [x] the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- [x] the marketeer can choose one option
- [x] the game will choose a random option
- [x] a winner will be declared

## Bonus Aims: Multiplayer

- [ ] Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

## Bonus Aims: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

- [ ] Use the _special_ rules ( _you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock_ )

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
